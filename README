In the beginning the program will ask the user in which mode to play.The user will have to enter 1 for player vs player mode and 2 for player vs computer mode.
After that program will ask for the player names.
After entering names user will have to give inputs in form of row and columns corresponding to the cell in which they want to move.
The program will be guiding users in all the steps by showing the game progress, player's turn and all other important steps users have to take while playing.
All the important instructions, uses of different methods and variables are mentioned as comments in the source code. 
I have checked the program for multiple test cases and it ran erfectly without any exceptions or ambiguity. 
THANKS
